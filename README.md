## Known bugs

### Note

This extension can be buggy, as the gnome-shell's blur implementation is quite flawed in some ways.

To entirely remove artifacts from the top panel, you can use static blur with the appropriate switch, **use static blur**.

Moreover, if you don't use static blur, selecting *no artifacts* in the settings allows the blur to regenerate itself a lot better, at the expense of CPU time (but cannot currently tell the difference, less than 0.5% CPU on my middle-range i5)

Selecting another profile might be enough (especially if you have disabled animations and/or windows borders), feel free to test!

### List of bugs

- artifacts on blurred parts [gnome shell bug](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/2857)
